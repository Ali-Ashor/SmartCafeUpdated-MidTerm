# SmartCafeUpdated-MidTerm
# ☕ Smart Cafe Ordering System (Extended Version)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Cafe Ordering System** is a console-based Python application developed for the **Software Construction and Development Lab**.
This project simulates a semi-realistic cafe management system with support for customers, staff, dynamic menu handling, and order processing.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
* Implement modular programming structure
* Practice file handling and exception handling
* Simulate real-world ordering and billing system

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Menu Management

* Add, remove, and update menu items
* Categorized menu (Drinks, Fast Food, Desserts)
* Dynamic loading from file

### 🔹 Order System

* Multiple items per order
* Quantity support
* Remove item from order
* Subtotal + Tax (5%) + Total calculation

### 🔹 Customer Features

* Unique Customer ID
* Multiple orders support
* Order history tracking

### 🔹 Staff/Admin Role

* Menu management functionality
* Implemented using inheritance

### 🔹 File Handling

* Save menu data in `menu.txt`
* Load menu on program start
* Basic data persistence

### 🔹 Billing System

* Formatted receipt generation
* Displays subtotal, tax, and total

### 🔹 Exception Handling

* Handles invalid input
* Prevents empty order checkout
* Handles file errors

### 🔹 Search & Filter

* Search items by name
* Filter items by category

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used

* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance (Person → Customer, Staff)
* Composition (Order contains MenuItems)
* Encapsulation
* Modularity

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required

---

## 🔥 Git Requirements (STRICT - EXAM)

### ✅ Minimum Commits

* At least **20 commits required**

### ✅ Commit Message Guidelines

Use meaningful messages such as:

* "Added MenuItem class"
* "Implemented Order class with quantity support"
* "Added remove item functionality"
* "Implemented file handling for menu"
* "Added billing system with tax calculation"
* "Implemented search and filter functionality"

❌ Avoid:

* "update"
* "changes"
* "fix"

---

### 🌿 Branching Strategy (MANDATORY)

You must create **at least 2 branches**:

#### 1. Menu Management Branch

```
feature/menu-management
```

#### 2. Order System Branch

```
feature/order-system
```

#### Example Commands:

```bash
git branch feature/menu-management
git branch feature/order-system
git checkout feature/menu-management
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts for Viva

* **Vector vs List** → Python uses dynamic lists
* **Inheritance** → Code reuse and hierarchy
* **Composition** → Order HAS-A MenuItem
* **File Handling** → Persistent storage
* **Modularity** → Code divided into multiple files
* **Exception Handling** → Prevents crashes

---

## ⭐ Bonus Features (Optional)

* Discount system (e.g., student discount)
* Login system (username/password)
* Improved UI/UX

---

## 📸 Deliverables Checklist

* ✔ Source Code (Modular)
* ✔ GitHub Repository (20+ commits)
* ✔ Proper README file
* ✔ Output screenshots
* ✔ Viva demonstration
* ✔ Contribution report
